Problem: I have a lot of student loans to pay off
and I want to know the best way to distrubute my tax return
A genetic algorithm consists of five phases

1)Initial Population
2)Fitness Calculation
3)Selection
4)Crossover
5)Mutation

I have five loans and 4k to put on them
what way would be the most efficient to way 
to distribute the money.

What is effciency?
in this case effciency is lowering the amount of interest 
to be a minium

Every Loan consists of an Interest Rate and a Principle amount
lowering the principle will decrease the interest rate.

So the fittest would be the first two which lower the 
total interest the most.
